# MPPT Solar Charge Controller

This project is a **Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) Solar Charge Controller** designed as part of the EEE 316 Power Electronics Laboratory course at BUET. It aims to optimize the energy harvested from photovoltaic (PV) panels by ensuring the system operates at its Maximum Power Point under varying environmental conditions.

## Overview

The controller uses the **Perturb and Observe (P\&O)** algorithm, implemented via an **Arduino Nano**, to dynamically adjust the operating point of the solar panel for maximum efficiency. A **SEPIC DC-DC converter** is employed for voltage regulation, capable of both step-up and step-down conversion depending on input conditions. The system intelligently manages charging a 12V lead-acid battery and running a load simultaneously.
